# Alzheimer's Shell - For Those Who Forget

*Terminal utility to help you remember commands.*

Old workflow:
  - Try a command, doesn't work
  - Switch to a browser
  - Do a google search
  - Go to stackoverflow
  - Go back to google
  - Try another search
  - Go again to stackoverflow
  - Scroll down
  - Copy command
  - Paste command in shell
  - Edit command
  - Execute command

New workflow:
 - Start typing a command in shell. Possible completions are suggested (based on usages and history...)
 - Select the right suggestion
 - Execute command
